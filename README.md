# Friend-Or-Foe
FriendOrFoe is a collection of environmental datasets obtained from metabolic modeling of microbial communities [AGORA](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3703) and [CARVEME](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/15/7542/5042022).  FriendOrFoe gathers 64 tabular datasets, which were constructed by analysing more than 10 000 pairs of microbes. Our collection is suitable for four machine learning frameworks.
